# Final_Project

This is our final project for BSC degree. We implemented two software based defenses against spoofing attacks on IoT sensors.

To compile the project please install mbed-cli and then you can use the Build_and_copy script (for windwos only for now).
You will need to give it the full path for the copy as an first argument.

We used python script to collect the data and saved it on our systems.
